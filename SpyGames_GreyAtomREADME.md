### Project Overview

 This project 'Spy Games' provides a basic hands-on experience on the usage of basic python concepts to get familiarized with the syntax and usecases.
 


### Learnings from the project

 1. How to create functions
2. File operations
3. Creating lambda functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Since this was my first project in Python, I tried focusing on the syntactial and logical aspects of the code to solve the questions. I aim to get proficient with this so that in future projects I can focus on writing optimized code


### Challenges faced

 Whenever I was stuck, I tried to debug the error by going through the error message, checking for syntax errors or basic concepts that could have been missed and finally if that didn't help then looked on internet to understand and resolve the error
